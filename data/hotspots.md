## 5. R to @AnthropicAI: A central lesson of this work is that autonomy is co-constructed by the model, user, and product. It can't be fully characterized by pre-deployment evaluations alone.

For full details, and our recommendations to developers and policymakers, see the blog: https://www.anthropic.com/research/measuring-agent-autonomy

## 6. R to @AnthropicAI: Software engineering makes up ~50% of agentic tool calls on our API, but we see emerging use in other industries. 

As the frontier of risk and autonomy expands, post-deployment monitoring becomes essential. We encourage other model developers to extend this research.

## 7. R to @AnthropicAI: Most agent actions on our API are low risk. 73% of tool calls appear to have a human in the loop, and only 0.8% are irreversible.

But at the frontier, we see agents acting on security systems, financial transactions, and production deployments (though some may be evals).

## 8. R to @AnthropicAI: Claude Code also encourages oversight by stopping to ask questions.

On complex tasks, Claude Code pauses for clarification more than twice as often as humans interrupt it. Training models to recognize uncertainty is an important, under-appreciated safety property.

## 9. R to @AnthropicAI: But interruptions also increase with experience. New users interrupt Claude Code in 5% of turns, compared to 9% for more experienced users.

This suggests a shift from approving each action to delegating and interrupting when needed.

New users approve each action individually. By 750 sessions, over 40% of sessions are fully auto-approved.

## 11. R to @AnthropicAI: Most Claude Code turns are short (median ~45 seconds). But the longest turns show where autonomy is heading.

In three months, the 99.9th percentile turn duration nearly doubled, from under 25 minutes to over 45 minutes. This growth is smooth across model releases.

Understanding this spectrum is critical for safe deployment, yet we know surprisingly little about how people actually use agents in the real world.

## 32. RT by @GoogleDeepMind: 6 months in, after the IMO-gold achievement, I’m very excited to share another important  milestone: AI can help accelerate knowledge discovery in mathematics, physics, and computer science! We’re sharing Two new papers from @GoogleDeepMind and @GoogleResearch that explore how Gemini #DeepThink together with agentic workflows can empower mathematicians and scientists to tackle professional research problems. Some highlights:

The first paper built a research agent #Aletheia, powered by an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think, that can autonomously produce publishable math research and crack open Erdős problems.

The second paper, built on similar agentic reasoning ideas, helped resolve bottlenecks in 18 research problems, across algorithms, ML and combinatorial optimization, information theory and economics.

See the thread for details about the two papers and the joint blog post.
