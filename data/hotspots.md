## 12. R to @AnthropicAI: A central lesson of this work is that autonomy is co-constructed by the model, user, and product. It can't be fully characterized by pre-deployment evaluations alone.

## 13. R to @AnthropicAI: Software engineering makes up ~50% of agentic tool calls on our API, but we see emerging use in other industries. 

As the frontier of risk and autonomy expands, post-deployment monitoring becomes essential. We encourage other model developers to extend this research.

## 14. R to @AnthropicAI: Most agent actions on our API are low risk. 73% of tool calls appear to have a human in the loop, and only 0.8% are irreversible.

But at the frontier, we see agents acting on security systems, financial transactions, and production deployments (though some may be evals).

## 15. R to @AnthropicAI: Claude Code also encourages oversight by stopping to ask questions.

On complex tasks, Claude Code pauses for clarification more than twice as often as humans interrupt it. Training models to recognize uncertainty is an important, under-appreciated safety property.

## 16. R to @AnthropicAI: But interruptions also increase with experience. New users interrupt Claude Code in 5% of turns, compared to 9% for more experienced users.

This suggests a shift from approving each action to delegating and interrupting when needed.

New users approve each action individually. By 750 sessions, over 40% of sessions are fully auto-approved.

## 18. R to @AnthropicAI: Most Claude Code turns are short (median ~45 seconds). But the longest turns show where autonomy is heading.

In three months, the 99.9th percentile turn duration nearly doubled, from under 25 minutes to over 45 minutes. This growth is smooth across model releases.

Understanding this spectrum is critical for safe deployment, yet we know surprisingly little about how people actually use agents in the real world.
