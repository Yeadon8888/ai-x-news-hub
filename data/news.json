      "summary": "Happy for my brother. An absolute triumph for Benchmark. Jack Altman (@jaltma) I’m really excited to share that I’m joining Benchmark. The past two years as a full time investor have been the most rewarding of my career. I really love venture capital, which is not something I ever imagined I’d say when I was kid, but here we are. I love new ideas and being part of a team with a mission. I love getting to be there for people who are struggling towards goals they really care about. I love learning from people who are better CEOs than I ever was. I love the texture of the work, the competition, and the way the job lets you invest in relationships. I love it so much that I’ve even turned into a little venture nerd with a podcast who goes around harassing great investors and founders, trying to learn as much as I can as fast as possible. I’ve certainly learned what I care most about, and what kind of investor I want to be. What I’ve realized is that I love investing at the Series A, when there’s enough going on that an investor can be useful but not so much that you can’t have an impact. I think there are many amazing ways to practice venture, it’s just the way that most speaks to me. And as I came to realize that, I started to think about how to best set myself up to do that craft as well as possible. It became clear to me there is nowhere better for this than Benchmark; the way they’re structured, their principles, their overall approach to investing, and their track record all create an environment that I believe will let me do my best work as an investor and help founders the most I possibly can. As I’ve gotten to know the team at Benchmark I’ve come to admire so much about each of them. Peter is truly playing his own game. A lot of what he says sounds like poetry at first, but as the ideas roll around in your head for a while you realize how much depth they have. I first heard about Eric many years ago from my friend Saji at Benchling while I was building Lattice, who described him as the most amazing board member and attributed him with a lot of the company’s success. That’s the kind of partner I want to be one day. Chetan is brilliant and truly thinks for himself; I’ve realized over time what a courageous guy he is. And then there’s my friend Ev, whose skills complement mine and who I just love to be around. I can’t wait to have him as a partner in crime. When given the chance to work with this group I just knew I had to go. One of my motivating north stars with Alt Capital was to build a firm and be a partner that I most would have wanted as an entrepreneur. Although I haven’t gotten everywhere I want to be yet, I’m proud of the work so far. And now I’m excited to build on that work at Benchmark, where I hope to increase my rate of learning and get armed with the power of a partnership so I can help founders reach their dreams even more. Thank you to the companies who’ve let me invest with them at Alt Cap. I’m keeping all my board seats and supporting everyone just the same as before. Thank you to the LPs who’ve backed me as well. I am so excited about the portfolio we have and am grateful I can stick with all those companies. And finally thank you to my teammates, Bala, Vivek, and Nate. Bala took a bet on me and started investing with me before it was remotely obvious, and we’ve been able to grow so much figuring it out together as investors. I credit Nate with helping Alt start feeling like a firm. He joined us from First Round over a year ago and made everything run smoothly. And while Vivek joined just a little while ago, even in the short time we’ve worked together he’s had a meaningful impact on how we think and invest. They’re all joining Benchmark with me. So pumped for this chapter. — https://nitter.net/jaltma/status/2023797494384390558#m",

Joshua Kushner (@JoshuaKushner) We are pleased to announce the close of Thrive X. Exceeding $10 billion, Thrive X comprises $1 billion designated for early-stage investments and $9 billion designated for growth-stage investments. We do not view this as a milestone, but as a commitment to the long work ahead. We view Thrive as a company. Our product is partnership - the willingness to commit deeply to a small number of founders, and to stand with them through momentum and adversity. This is the discipline we bring to our work, and the responsibility we accept when founders partner with Thrive. We do not hedge. Concentration demands loyalty to the founders and missions we back. In this moment, exposure alone is not a strategy. Judgment without commitment is not enough. Advantage will accrue to those who choose deliberately, commit deeply, and endure through difficult moments. Thrive was founded to be an enabling technology for the world we want to see. We are deeply aware that we are not the main character. The founders that we are fortunate enough to partner with are the artists. Our role is to help create the conditions where great work can come to life. We take a long view grounded in the belief that category-defining companies tend to create structural compounding advantages over long arcs. This fund reflects the continuity of our approach and the ways our work has deepened alongside the founders we support.

I agree with Jakub this is perhaps the most important eval now. I am also pretty sure the main reaction will be \"it's not that hard\" :) Jakub Pachocki (@merettm) Very excited about the \"First Proof\" challenge. I believe novel frontier research is perhaps the most important way to evaluate capabilities of the next generation of AI models. We have run our internal model with limited human supervision on the ten proposed problems. The problems require expertise in their respective domains and are not easy to verify; based on feedback from experts, we believe at least six solutions (2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10) have a high chance of being correct, and some further ones look promising. We will only publish the solution attempts after midnight (PT), per the authors' guidance - the sha256 hash of the PDF is d74f090af16fc8a19debf4c1fec11c0975be7d612bd5ae43c24ca939cd272b1a . This was a side-sprint executed in a week mostly by querying one of the models we're currently training; as such, the methodology we employed leaves a lot to be desired. We didn't provide proof ideas or mathematical suggestions to the model during this evaluation; for some solutions, we asked the model to expand upon some proofs, per expert feedback. We also manually facilitated a back-and-forth between this model and ChatGPT for verification, formatting and style. For some problems, we present the best of a few attempts according to human judgement. We are looking forward to more controlled evaluations in the next round! 1stproof.org #1stProof — https://nitter.net/merettm/status/2022517085193277874#m",

Jakub Pachocki (@merettm) Very excited about the \"First Proof\" challenge. I believe novel frontier research is perhaps the most important way to evaluate capabilities of the next generation of AI models. We have run our internal model with limited human supervision on the ten proposed problems. The problems require expertise in their respective domains and are not easy to verify; based on feedback from experts, we believe at least six solutions (2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10) have a high chance of being correct, and some further ones look promising. We will only publish the solution attempts after midnight (PT), per the authors' guidance - the sha256 hash of the PDF is d74f090af16fc8a19debf4c1fec11c0975be7d612bd5ae43c24ca939cd272b1a . This was a side-sprint executed in a week mostly by querying one of the models we're currently training; as such, the methodology we employed leaves a lot to be desired. We didn't provide proof ideas or mathematical suggestions to the model during this evaluation; for some solutions, we asked the model to expand upon some proofs, per expert feedback. We also manually facilitated a back-and-forth between this model and ChatGPT for verification, formatting and style. For some problems, we present the best of a few attempts according to human judgement. We are looking forward to more controlled evaluations in the next round! 1stproof.org #1stProof — https://nitter.net/merettm/status/2022517085193277874#m",
